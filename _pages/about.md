This is Lixu Wang. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University (NU) starting in Spring 2021, advised by Prof. Qi Zhu and Prof. Xiao Wang, and partially supported by IBM PhD Fellowship. Prior to Northwestern, I obtained my B.E. from Zhejiang University (ZJU) in July 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Wenyuan Xu.  I am open to all kinds of collaboration, please drop me an email if you are interested in my research. I am currently visiting Rice University and working with Prof. Xia Ben Hu.
