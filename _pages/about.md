This is Lixu Wang. I am now visiting Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and working with [Prof. Wei Dong](https://weidong.hk/) and [Prof. Xiaofeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) from Indiana University. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University (NU), advised by [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TN09YMcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io/), and partially supported by [IBM PhD Fellowship](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html). Prior to Northwestern, I obtained my B.E. from Zhejiang University (ZJU) in July 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I am open to all kinds of collaboration, please email me if you are interested in my research.

I aim to contribute to Data-Centric Responsible AI, where my current interest is to achieve Controllable Customization for Large Models. In this topic, I focus on the content and user control of large foundation models, i.e., 1) what content should be included in models; 2) what content should be excluded from models; and 3) who should be authorized to use the models. Solving these problems benefits major facets of responsible AI, like ensuring data and model privacy protection, enhancing model reliability and accountability, aligning for benign purposes, and preventing harmful misuse. To achieve these goals, I have been developing novel techniques and approaches related to Federated Learning, Out-Source Training, Machine Unlearning, Generalization Restriction, and Multi-Party Computation with a diverse set of knowledge in Optimization Theory, Information Theory, and Cryptography.
